    "While the bisection method is reliable, it is too slow for most practical applications. The bisection method uses very little information about the function (only its sign on the boundaries). If we use more information, we can improve the method. In the secant method we approximate the function as a straight line (or secant) going through points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$ (see Figure \\ref{fig: secant} below), where $[a,b]$ is our interval containing the root. The new approximation of the root is chosen as the intersection of the secant with the $x$-axis.\n",
