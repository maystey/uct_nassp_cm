# Linear Regression Algorithms

Regression is used to fit models to data <!--- Mention machine learning --->
In this chapter we cover how to implement two linear regression algorithms. We then use SciPy to perform the similar algorithms, but for non-linear cases as well.

- Finding the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- Uses
    - Curve fitting
    - Machine learning
