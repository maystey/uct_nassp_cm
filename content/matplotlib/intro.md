# Matplotlib

In this chapter we shall take a quick look at plotting with Matplotlib's Pyplot module. Matplotlib offers many plotting functions and plots have many features that can be tweaked. For these reasons we will only be scratching the surface of using Matplotlib. A good resource for finding out what is possible is the [Matplotlib Thumbnail Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) which features many example plots along with their source code. The matplotlib documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html).
